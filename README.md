Requirements:
Java v22.0.2 (Azul Zulu SDK)
GDAL 3.9.0 or newer



Concerning GDAL:

GDAL's java bindings MUST be built from source using cmake. There are a number of other dependencies you will need to
be able to successfully build gdal and the bindings.

The minimum requirements to build GDAL are:

    CMake >= 3.16, and an associated build system (make, ninja, Visual Studio, etc.)

    C99 compiler

    C++17 compiler since GDAL 3.9 (C++11 in previous versions)

    PROJ >= 6.3.1

Additional requirements to run the GDAL test suite are:

    SWIG >= 4, for building bindings to other programming languages

    Python >= 3.8

    Python packages listed in autotest/requirements.txt

more info on building from source can be found here:
https://gdal.org/en/stable/development/building_from_source.html
https://gdal.org/en/stable/api/java/index.html

for the first cmake command we want to specify that we would like to build the java bindings. this is set to "ON" by default but if we explicity
specify this option then cmake should tell us if we are missing any dependencies and abort if that is the case. Otherwise it would continue with
the build if we are missing dependencies for the java bindings, and just build without java bindings.

ex: "cmake .. -DBUILD_JAVA_BINDINGS=ON"             ------>   the leading "D" here is important. forgetting to begin build configs with this will cause issues



I would advise to pipe your output from the final stage of the build process into a text file. The output will display
the installation locations for all of GDAL. These locations will be useful when setting up PATH environment variables
on your system. You can do this by using ">" after the cmake command and enter a file name if the file is in the same directory or the full path
to the file if it is in another directory.

ex: 'cmake --build . --target install > output.txt

this will not show any output in the terminal, if you want to also see the output in the console look into how the "tee" terminal command works.
you can also just choose to leave your terminal window open until you get things working properly.



You will need to add the path to the wherever your libgdal.so (libgdal.dll on windows) folder, which contains library files for gdal, to your system
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (PATH on windows). There are both temporary and permanent ways to do this, and we want the permanent
option. How to do this will vary depending on operating system.

Then add the following as VM arguments in your build options in intellij:
 -Djava.library.path={path to jni folder}

If this does not work, you may also need to add this to the build configuration. open the build config and in the box labeled: "Environment Variables" add:

PATH={path to libgdal.dll):$PATH

# Explanation of WKT Georeferencing Information

This document explains the various fields in the WKT (Well-Known Text) georeferencing information for the coordinate system "WGS 84 / UTM zone 31N".

---

## 1. PROJCS (Projected Coordinate System)

- **Name ("WGS 84 / UTM zone 31N")**  
  Indicates the overall name of the projected coordinate system. It shows that the data is based on the WGS 84 geographic reference and uses the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) projection for zone 31N.

---

## 2. GEOGCS (Geographic Coordinate System)

This section defines the underlying geographic coordinate system.

- **"WGS 84"**  
  The name of the geographic coordinate system. WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984) is a globally recognized reference system.

- **DATUM ("WGS_1984")**  
  The datum defines how the spheroid is positioned relative to the Earth.
    - **SPHEROID ("WGS 84", 6378137, 298.257223563)**
        - *6378137*: The semi-major axis (in meters) of the ellipsoid.
        - *298.257223563*: The inverse flattening, describing the ellipsoid’s compression at the poles.
        - *AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]*: EPSG authority code for the spheroid.

    - **AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]**  
      EPSG code for the WGS 84 datum.

- **PRIMEM ("Greenwich", 0)**  
  The prime meridian used is Greenwich, with a longitude of 0°.
    - *AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]*: EPSG code for the Greenwich prime meridian.

- **UNIT ("degree", 0.0174532925199433)**  
  The angular unit used is the degree. The provided number is the conversion factor from degrees to radians (approximately 0.0174533 radians per degree).
    - *AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]*: EPSG code for the degree unit.

- **AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]**  
  EPSG code for the geographic coordinate system WGS 84.

---

## 3. PROJECTION

- **"Transverse_Mercator"**  
  Indicates that the projection method is Transverse Mercator, which is suitable for regions that extend primarily in the north-south direction as it minimizes distortion within a narrow zone.

---

## 4. PARAMETER Fields

These parameters are specific to the Transverse Mercator projection and the UTM system:

- **latitude_of_origin (0)**  
  The latitude at which the projection surface touches the Earth. For UTM, this is typically the equator (0°).

- **central_meridian (3)**  
  The longitude that acts as the center of the projection. In UTM zone 31N, the central meridian is 3° East.

- **scale_factor (0.9996)**  
  A scaling factor used to reduce distortion. For UTM, a scale factor of 0.9996 is standard.

- **false_easting (500000)**  
  A value added to the x-coordinates (eastings) to ensure they remain positive. The standard value for UTM is 500,000 meters.

- **false_northing (0)**  
  A value added to the y-coordinates (northings). In the northern hemisphere, this is typically 0 (while in the southern hemisphere, a false northing is used to ensure positive values).

---

## 5. UNIT (Linear Unit)

- **"metre", 1**  
  Specifies that the linear units for the projected coordinates are in meters. A conversion factor of 1 means that 1 unit in the projection equals 1 meter.
    - *AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]*: EPSG code for the meter unit.

---

## 6. AXIS Definitions

- **AXIS["Easting", EAST]**  
  Defines the first coordinate axis as the easting (horizontal axis pointing eastward).

- **AXIS["Northing", NORTH]**  
  Defines the second coordinate axis as the northing (vertical axis pointing northward).

- **AUTHORITY["EPSG","32631"]**  
  The EPSG code for the entire projected coordinate system "WGS 84 / UTM zone 31N".

---

## Summary

This WKT string provides a comprehensive description of the coordinate system:

- It is based on the WGS 84 geographic coordinate system.
- It uses the UTM projection method (specifically zone 31N) with the Transverse Mercator projection.
- It includes detailed definitions for the datum, spheroid, angular and linear units, and projection parameters that ensure accurate mapping with minimal distortion.

This explanation should help clarify the purpose and meaning of each field within the georeferencing information.
